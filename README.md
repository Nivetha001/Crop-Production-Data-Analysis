##  Project Title: Crop Production Data Analysis - India

### üîé Why Data Analysis ??
_____________________________
- Data analysis is important in business to understand problems facing an organisation, and to explore data in meaningful ways. Data in itself is merely facts and figures. Data analysis organises, interprets, structures and presents the data into useful information that provides context for the data. This context can then be used by decision-makers to take action with the aim of enhancing productivity and business gain.

### üìùSteps of Data Analysis
____________________________________
- Collect the Data
- Understand the Business
- Ask the Right Data Analysis Questions
- Data Cleaning
- Data Analyzing
- Data Visualization
- Interpret Results 
 
 ### üìå Dataset
 ___________________________________
 
  - Datasets is available in the given link. You can download here https://data.world/thatzprem/agriculture-india 
  - This is the  Data Analysis Project 'Crop Production Data Analysis - India' 
  - I have also created a Dashboard for this Data Analysis Project using Power bi and  Gathered the Better Insights from the dataset based on the production statement wise, year     wise, crop wise, Area wise, District wise, Production Wise, Season Wise

 ### What is Data Visualization?
 ________________________________
- With so much information being collected through data analysis in the business world today, we must have a way to paint a picture of that data so we can interpret it. Data       visualization gives us a clear idea of what the information means by giving it visual context through maps or graphs. This makes the data more natural for the human mind to     comprehend and therefore makes it easier to identify trends, patterns, and outliers within large data sets. 

###  Why is Data Visualization Important?
_________________________________________
No matter what business or career you‚Äôve chosen, data visualization can help by delivering data in the most efficient way possible. As one of the essential steps in the business intelligence process, data visualization takes the raw data, models it, and delivers the data so that conclusions can be reached. In advanced analytics, data scientists are creating machine learning algorithms to better compile essential data into visualizations that are easier to understand and interpret.

Specifically, data visualization uses visual data to communicate information in a manner that is universal, fast, and effective. This practice can help companies identify which areas need to be improved, which factors affect customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction, and what to do with specific products (where should they go and who should they be sold to). Visualized data gives stakeholders, business owners, and decision-makers a better prediction of sales volumes and future growth.
