## For removing duplicate records from the table i used row number() function.
## first the CTE uses the ROW_NUMBER() function to find the duplicate rows specified by values in the id,name,sal columns.
## then,the delete statement deletes all the duplicate rows but keeps only one occurence of each duplicate group.
